#usage
#Here we don't set the env var yet
# python main.py

# ðŸ’¬ As we didn't set the env var, we get the default value

# Hello World from Python

# ðŸ’¬ But if we create an environment variable first
# export MY_NAME="Wade Wilson"

# ðŸ’¬ And then call the program again
# python main.py

# ðŸ’¬ Now it can read the environment variable

# Hello Wade Wilson from Python
